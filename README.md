## What this Repository is for you :monocle_face: ##

<b>If you're a recruiter</b> looking into my github page and stumbled upon this project, welcome! Feel free to sift through the code to get a feeling for my coding style. I hope you may come to a generous conclusion as to my programming abilities. However, I find it important to highlight the fact that this is meant to serve as documentation through my never-ending journey of learning new technologies. This repository highlights one of, if not the, first project that I started developing for back-end Java programming.

<b>If you're an open source contributor</b> who happened to run into this repository, I'm afraid there really isn't any room for contribution. There will hopefully be other open source repositories that will need contribution, however this isn't one of them.

## What this Repository is for me :nerd_face: ##

This repository is meant as a public repository into which I'm publishing my personal journy through learning back-end systems using the Java language. This is the first project that I feel confident enough to develop publicly for future eyes that are curious enough to explore.

## Scope of this Project ##

This project is meant to be an online webapp for internet chatting. The idea is to have a primary page in which users can type in their name, and then develop a chatting system using websockets as the primary technology. The idea of using JSP as the front end templating engine is simply because it's such a popular technology and there are many projects still using it. I will also be using a logging framework to keep track of important information. Lastly, and most importantly, this application will be developed, tested, and ran on <b>Apache Tomcat 9.0</b>. A simple web container like Tomcat will be enough to handle the small scope of this project.
